# Negotiation Strategy Report

A Python-based application to generate a negotiation strategy report with the goal of lowering costs by 10%.

## Quick Install

Before running the software, you need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 🤔 What is this?

This software is designed to help businesses create a negotiation strategy report. It takes an Excel file as input, calculates potential savings of 10% on current costs, and generates a new Excel file with the calculated savings and new costs.

## Main Functions

1. **File Selection:** The software prompts the user to select an Excel file that contains the current costs.

2. **Cost Calculation:** The software calculates the potential savings of 10% on the current costs and the new costs after the savings.

3. **Report Generation:** The software generates a new Excel file named 'Negotiation_Strategy_Report.xlsx' with the calculated savings and new costs.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` file in your terminal. You will be prompted to select an Excel file. Make sure the Excel file contains a column named 'Current Cost' with the current costs.

2. Once you select the file, the software will calculate the savings and new costs and generate a new Excel file named 'Negotiation_Strategy_Report.xlsx'.

3. You can find the 'Negotiation_Strategy_Report.xlsx' file in the same directory as your `main.py` file.
